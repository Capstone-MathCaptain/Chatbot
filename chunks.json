Some have claimed that this\napproach can produce dramatic improvements in body composition. It has even been postulated that the\ntiming of nutritional consumption may be more important than the absolute daily intake of nutrients. The\npost-exercise period is widely considered the most critical part of nutrient timing."

The purpose of the study was to \nexamine whether the second bout of exercise in an unrecovered \nstate would exacerbate performance decrements and elevation \nof the muscle damage marker in the blood [116]. Perceived \nsoreness, elbow joint angles, isometric strength, and creatine \nkinase were measured. No measure had returned to initial val-\nues by day 5 post-exercise."

The isometric strength of both groups A and \nB significantly decreased following the first bout of training \nand produced only 45% and 40% of initial strength, respec-\ntively. When the second bout was performed, group A had \nregained 66% of initial strength, whereas group B regained \n87% of baseline strength.

The \nresults of the study demonstrated that recovery time following \nthe repeated bout was faster compared with following the ini-\ntial bout whether or not muscle functions were fully restored. \nSimilar results were reported in a follow-up study where a \nbout of eccentric exercise was repeated 3 and 6 days after the \ninitial bout, and no indication of increased muscle damage or \nslowed recovery were documented [117]."

A hypertrophy-oriented program\nshould employ a repetition range of 6–12 reps per set with rest\nintervals of 60–90 seconds between sets."

It has been proposed that muscle protein synthesis is\nmaximized in young adults with an intake of ~ 20–25 g of a high-quality protein; anything above this amount is\nbelieved to be oxidized for energy or transaminated to form urea and other organic acids. However, these findings are\nspecific to the provision of fast-digesting proteins without the addition of other macronutrients."
